Vitabiotics have researched this extensively and recommend that after chewing some food (e.g. banana), just before you swallow, pop the tablet into your mouth and swallow it together with the chewed food, followed by some liquid. The throat opens up wider to swallow the chewed food and so the tablet should go down with greater ease. Alternatively, the tablets may be swallowed with thicker liquids such as yoghurts or smoothies.<\/p><p>If you are looking for an alternative to tablets, then we also offer a range of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vitabiotics.com\/collections\/liquid-vitamins\">Liquid Vitamins<\/a> and chewable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vitabiotics.com\/collections\/vitamin-gummies\">Vitamin Gummies<\/a>. <\/p>",
